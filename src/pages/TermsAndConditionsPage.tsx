          mobile application (the "App"), provided by Collectiq ("we," "our," or "us"). By accessing or using the App,
          you agree to be bound by these Terms and our Privacy Policy. If you disagree with any part of the terms, then
          you may not access the App.
        </p>

        <h2>1. Access and Use of the App</h2>

          <li>
            <strong>Eligibility:</strong> You must be at least 13 years old to use the App. By using the App, you
            represent and warrant that you meet this age requirement.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>License to Use:</strong> We grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license
            to use the App for your personal, non-commercial purposes, subject to these Terms.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. User Accounts</h2>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-5 mb-4 space-y-2">
          <li>
            <strong>Account Creation:</strong> To access certain features of the App, you must register for an account
            using your email, a password, and a unique username. You agree to provide accurate, current, and complete
            information during the registration process and to update such information to keep it accurate, current, and
            complete.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Account Responsibility:</strong> You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your
            account login information (username and password) and for all activities that occur under your account. You
            agree to notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your account.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. User Content</h2>

          The App allows you to create, upload, post, link, store, share, and otherwise make available certain
          information, text, graphics, videos, or other material ("User Content").
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-5 mb-4 space-y-2">

          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Public vs. Private Collections:</strong> You can designate your collections as "public" or
            "private." Public collections and their associated items will be visible to all other App users. Private
            collections and their items will only be visible to you. User Item data (personal notes, purchase price, and
            specific photos you upload for your owned items) is always private to you, even if the general item or
            collection is public.

            <strong>License to Collectiq:</strong> By making your User Content available on or through the App

            license to use, reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works of, display, and perform that User Content
            in connection with the App and Collectiq's (and its successors' and affiliates') business, including without
            limitation for promoting and redistributing part or all of the App (and derivative works thereof) in any
            media formats and through any media channels. This license is solely for the purpose of operating,
            improving, and promoting the App.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Representations and Warranties:</strong> You represent and warrant that your User Content does not
            violate any third-party rights, including copyright, trademark, privacy, publicity, or other personal or
            proprietary rights.
          </li>
